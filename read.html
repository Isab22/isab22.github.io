<ul>

    <li> Fantasy including: Harry potter, Game of Thrones, and Lord of the Rings</li>   
    <li>  Non-Fictions! If you don't know where to start when trying to find these genre of books, try the Who Was books. For example:  Who Was Walt Disney, Who Was Princess Diana, and Who Was Albert Einstein </li>
    <li> Mystery including: Nancy Drew, Boxcar children, and if you want a longer more adult book you can try One of Us is Lying.</li>
    <li>And finally,one of my favorite genre of book, Graphic Novel. Some of my favorites are Pashmina, Smile, and Drama. </li>
